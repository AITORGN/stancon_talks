Stancon notebook correction notes and bio

+++++ CORRECTION NOTES +++++
Here are the changes I’ve made. Please thank the reviewers for the really helpful comments - I’ve learned a lot from them!

> ‘STAN’ changed to ‘Stan’ throughout
> More discussion of priors, identification strategy and centred vs non-centred parameterisation
> Both difficulties and abilities made hierarchical in binary model
> Changed to non-centred parameterisation of difficulty parameters
> Vectorised where possible (i.e. not for the ordered logistic model)
> I couldn’t get `binary_sim_fit.get_sampler_params()[c]['n_divergent__’]` to work. However I tried `np.array([binary_sim_fit.get_sampler_params()[i]['divergent__’] for i in range(4)]).sum()` and got positive numbers using both a non-centred parameterisation and a centred parameterisation. I’m not sure exactly how to interpret this number so I’ve followed the reviewers’ advice and used a non-centred parameterisation.
> Changed Stan code style to match best practice: number-of-categories names are now single capital letters, and tabs have been replaced by double spaces
> Simplified simulation code
> Graded model made hierarchical to match the binary model, with extra hierarchical prior to set the scale of difficulty steps
> Fixed a bug that caused the intervals to display incorrectly
> models are now passed as files
> Added discussion of Football Radar’s application of IRT models


+++++ BIO +++++
I did a PhD in inductive logic and philosophy of statistics at Kent University, and I now work for Football Radar, a football statistics company based in London. I’m really interested in politics, Rudolf Carnap’s writing about probability and applying statistical methods to football.
