  ABSTRACT      = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model' complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

  ABSTRACT       = {Adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R; J. R. Anderson \& C. Lebiere, 1998) has evolved into a theory that consists of multiple modules but also explains how these modules are integrated to produce coherent cognition. The perceptual-motor modules, the goal module, and the declarative memory module are presented as examples of specialized systems in ACT-R. These modules are associated with distinct cortical regions. These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes. A number of simple and complex empirical examples are described to illustrate how these modules function singly and in concert.},
  ANNOTATION     = {* modules: 1. a visual module for identifying objects in the visual field, 2. manual module for controlling the hands, a declarative 3. module for retrieving information from memory, and a 4. goal module for keeping track of current goals and intentions Coordination in the behavior of these modules is achieved through a central production system. This central production system is not sensitive to most of the activity of these modules but rather can only respond to a limited amount of information that is deposited in the buffers of these modules. -the information in these modules is largely encapsulated, and the modules communicate only through the information they make available in their buffers. - The buffers of these modules hold the limited information that the production system can respond to. They * The core produc- tion system can recognize patterns in these buffers and make changes to these buffers, * production rules represent ACT–R’s procedural memory An important function of the production rules is to update the buffers in the ACT–R architecture. * Thus, the critical cycle in ACT–R is one in which the buffers hold repre- sentations determined by the external world and internal modules, patterns in these buffers are recognized, a production fires, and the buffers are then updated for another cycle. (The assumption in ACT–R is that this cycle takes about 50 ms to complete) * The conditions of the production rule specify a pattern of activity in the buffers that the rule will match, and the action specifies changes to be made to buffers. * mixture of parallel and serial processing: -Within each module, there is a great deal of parallelism Also, the processes within different modules can go on in parallel and asynchronously. However, there are also two levels of serial bottlenecks in the system. i), the content of any buffer is limited to a single declarative unit of knowledge, called a chunk in ACT–R. Thus, only a single memory can be retrieved at a time or only a single object can be encoded from the visual field. ii) only a single production is selected at each cycle to fire The ACT–R visual system: i) A visual-location module and buffer represent the dorsal where system ii) a visual-object module and buffer represent the ventral what system. When a production makes a request of the where system: the production specifies a series of constraints, and the where system returns a chunk representing a location meeting those constraints. Constraints are attribute–value pairs that can restrict the search based on visual properties of the object (such as “color: red”).Through the where system, ACT–R has knowledge of where allthe objects are. to identify an object, it must make a request of the what system: A request will cause the what system to shift visual attention to that location, process the object located there, and generate a declarative memory chunk represent- ing the object. Modules: * Goal Module cognitive core of ACT–R: * The declarative memory system * the procedural system , the activation of achunk is a sum of a base-level activation, reflecting its general usefulness in the past, and an associative activation, reflecting its relevance to the current context.},

@ARTICLE{McElree2000,
  ABSTRACT      = {Studies of working memory demonstrate that some forms of information are retrieved by a content-addressable mechanism (McElree \& Dosher, 1989; McElree, 1996, 1998), whereas others require a slower search-based mechanism (McElree \& Dosher, 1993). Measures of the speed and accuracy of processing sentences with filler-gap dependencies demonstrate that the probability of maintaining a representation of a filler item decreases as additional material is processed, but that the speed with which a preserved representation is accessed is unaffected by the amount of interpolated material. These results suggest that basic binding operations in sentence comprehension are mediated by a content-addressable memory system.},
